# Predictive-Model-for-Bank-Failures
 In this project, bank failures were predicted using advanced ML algorithms and historical financial data of over 94,000 FDIC-insured banks. A dataset of 38 key variables from 1984 onwards was prepared using FDIC's BankFind Suite API. The model accurately identified most failed banks, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting bank failures.
